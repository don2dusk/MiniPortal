# MiniPortal
Hi 👋🏾,
<br>
This is a scaled down version of my school's portal designed using C# and Windows Forms.
<br>
## How it All Began
I created the app because we were given a project(which eventually became our test) to create a Windows application that connects to the database at its backend.
<br>
I used C# and Visual Studio's Windows Forms framework for the front-end and used Microsoft's SQL Server connected via the Entity Framework (EF-Core).
<br>
This pre-release version allows you to create your student account and it stores the information on the database. Once you login you should be able to see your information displayed on the home page and based on the course you typed in would also display a prepared list of courses for the student. I was going to implement a way to register individual courses and it stores the information for the student but I unfortunately didn't have enough time to add that feature to it.

In a nutshell, this is a very simple demonstration of a Windows application with a database backend.
